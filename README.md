Hello, how should I utilise the sql JOIN clause to perform CRUD operations in NocoDB? Is there any other option except using "LinkToAnotherRecord" (based on PK and FK in an MS SQL database) and then looking up fields in NocoDB on a different column to accomplish this? I appreciate your support. https://www.tinashehair.com/product-category/wigs/
